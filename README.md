# Community Jam

## What is it?
CommunityJam is a version of the JavaJam which is kept running mostly by the community.

## Three Phases:

### Collection Phase
Everyone gets to submit topics which are controlled for legitimacy by experts or higher.

This is done by people sending their ideas into a text channel, where they get relayed into a team-channel until their legitimacy is proven.
they can then be voted for by everyone.

The topic with the most votes is chosen as the CommunityJam topic.
If two topics have equal vote count, this bot elects one of both.

### Submission Phase
Everyone has time to develop & publish their submissions on github.

Links to the repositories will be sent to the CommunityJam bot per DM.

### Voting Phase

The CommunityJam bot posts all links to a separate channel, in which people can vote for the submissions.
Submissions can be "reported" for reasons such as trolling, not following the topic, etc.
